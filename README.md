## Method

- For 1st or 3rd season,  $\omega_{i,t}$ is the simulated proportion of each stock (for $i$ = 1...10, the exact proportion is know), and $E_{t}$ is the holding information. 
- For $t-1$, complete position can be obtained ($E_{t-1}$ is known), and we have those in $E_{t-1}$ but not in $E_t$(for $t$ from 1 to 10), denotes $e_t$. This is the stocks we need to allocate proportion to.
- Denotes $I_{t,j}$ is the net value of industry $j$ divided by the net value of portfolio in $t-1$

## Defects and Improvements

- We complete the position based on stocks only, which means other asset types are excluded (bonds, etc).  There might be a huge gap between the real net-value and the net-value derived from the simulated weights of stock in the portfolio occasionally, but they have a high spearman correlation most of the time. 
- Buys and sells of portfolio manager should be chased. However, I suppose the ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\w_{i,t}) is constant.
